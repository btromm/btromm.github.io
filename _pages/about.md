I am primarily interested in the scientific study of the (altered states of) consciousness, complex systems & emergence, and artificial intelligence -- the intersection between neuroscience and AI (NeuroAI) is of particular relevance.

Presently, I'm on a gap year studying mathematics and computer science.

**Key interests:** consciousness science, psychedelics & altered states like meditation, whole-brain modeling, information theory, complexity & emergence, artificial intelligence
