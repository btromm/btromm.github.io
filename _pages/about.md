I am primarily interested in the scientific study of the (altered states of) consciousness, complex systems & emergence, and artificial intelligence -- the intersection between neuroscience and AI (NeuroAI) is of particular relevance.

Presently, I'm a research engineer at the [Neuronal Dynamics](https://www.neuronaldynamics.eu/) group in the Paris Brain Institute.

**Key interests:** consciousness science, psychedelics & altered states, whole-brain modeling, information theory, complexity & emergence, artificial intelligence
