I am primarily interested in the scientific study of the (altered states of) consciousness, complex systems & emergence, and artificial intelligence -- the intersection between neuroscience and AI (NeuroAI) is of particular relevance.

Presently, I work at the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing, where I'm examining the effects of chronic use of ayahuasca on the functional and hierarchical organization of the brain using whole-brain modeling and information theory.

**Key interests:** consciousness science, psychedelics & altered states like meditation, whole-brain modeling, information theory, complexity & emergence, artificial intelligence
