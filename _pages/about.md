I am primarily interested in the scientific study of consciousness, artificial intelligence, and complex/self-organizing systems, and how we can leverage this understanding to treat mental health conditions and enhance how we interact and live in this world.

As a visiting researcher at the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing at the University of Oxford, I explore the effects of chronic use of ayahuasca on the functional and hierarchical organization of the brain, using whole-brain modeling, multimodal neuroimaging, and dynamical systems and complexity approaches. I am passionate about advancing the scientific understanding of psychedelics and (altered states of) consciousness, and their implications for mental health and well-being.

I am also pursuing a master's degree in cognitive and clinical neuroscience at Maastricht University. I have a bachelor's degree in neuroscience from Brandeis University, where I graduated cum laude and received multiple scholarships for academic excellence. I have developed strong skills in computational neuroscience and multimodal neuroimaging analysis, and have contributed to several research projects and publications in the field.

**Key interests:** computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, neuroimaging, human sensory perception, subjective experience & data, consciousness science
