I am primarily interested in the scientific study of (altered states of) consciousness, complex systems & emergence, artificial intelligence, and complex/self-organizing systems, and how we can leverage this understanding to treat mental health conditions and enhance how we interact and live in this world.

Presently, I work at the Centre for Eudaimonia and Human Flourishing, where I'm examining the effects of chronic use of ayahuasca on the functional and hierarchical organization of the brain using whole-brain modeling and information theory.

**Key interests:** computational neuroscience, consciousness science, psychedelics & altered states like meditation, whole-brain modeling, information theory, complexity & emergence, artificial intelligence
